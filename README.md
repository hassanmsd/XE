## Product & Technical Decisions

### 1. Product Decisions

#### 1.1 Key Metrics at the Top

Displaying **Average Price**, **Top Rated**, **Stock Levels**, and **Common Categories** provides stakeholders with a quick overview of critical business metrics.

**Reason**: Focus on metrics that are actionable for business users, enabling them to make informed decisions at a glance.

#### 1.2 Main Table for Detailed Information

Shows core product data including ID, title, category, price, rating, and images.

**Reason**: Provides transparency into the data behind the metrics, allowing stakeholders to validate trends and analyze patterns in detail.

#### 1.3 Detail View Modal

Clicking on a row or detail icon opens an in-depth view with comprehensive information (description, images, brand, warranty, shipping info, etc.).

**Reason**: Keeps the main table concise and scannable while still providing deep-dive capabilities for users who need detailed product information.

#### 1.4 Pagination, Sorting, and Filtering

Users can navigate large datasets easily, sort by any column, and filter data based on specific criteria.

**Reason**: Improves usability and scalability without overwhelming the UI. Enables users to focus on relevant information quickly.

#### 1.5 Interactive UI Elements

Charts and table controls are fully interactive with clickable headers for sorting and three-dot menu for advanced filtering.

**Reason**: Enhances user engagement and allows quick insights without leaving the page or loading new views.

### 2. Technical Decisions

#### 2.1 API Layer Architecture

Custom API routes in Next.js (`/api/products`, `/api/top-rated`, `/api/stock-levels`, etc.) for modular data handling.

**Benefits**:

- Separates frontend and backend logic cleanly
- Makes testing easier and more maintainable
- Allows for independent scaling of API functionality
- Simplifies future migrations or integrations

#### 2.2 Pagination Implementation

Implemented both server-side and client-side pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.

**Benefits**:

- Reduces bandwidth usage and API response times
- Prevents slow rendering on the frontend
- Improves overall user experience with faster load times
- Scalable for datasets with thousands of products

#### 2.3 File Structure & Organization

Proper folder and file organization following Next.js best practices with clear separation of concerns.

**Benefits**:

- Makes the codebase flexible and maintainable
- Easier for new developers to understand and contribute
- Reusable components are properly modularized
- Clear API route structure for backend logic

#### 2.4 Test Coverage

Added unit tests and integration tests to verify API data fetching.

**Benefits**:

- Ensures data is fetched and calculated accurately
- Prevents regressions when adding new features
- Improves confidence in code changes
- Documents expected behavior through test cases

#### 2.5 Docker Containerization

Application packaged with Dockerfile for running in containerized environments.

**Benefits**:

- Simplifies deployment across different environments
- Ensures application runs consistently across machines
- Ready for containerized CI/CD pipelines
- Simplifies onboarding for new developers

#### 2.6 CI/CD Pipelines

Configured GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and quality checks.

**Benefits**:

- Continuous integration ensures code quality before deployment
- Automated testing catches issues early
- Reduces manual deployment errors
- Streamlines development workflow

#### 2.7 Cached Dummy Data

Implemented caching for API responses to prevent repeated fetching of static/dummy data.

**Benefits**:

- Reduces load on API endpoints
- Speeds up development iterations
- Ensures consistent data during testing
- Prevents rate limiting issues with external APIs

#### 2.8 Responsive Design

Charts, tables, modals, and dashboard layout are fully responsive across all device sizes.

**Benefits**:

- Stakeholders can access dashboard from desktop, tablet, or mobile
- Consistent user experience across devices
- No separate mobile app needed
- Better accessibility for users on-the-go

#### 2.9 Material-UI (MUI) Integration

Used for DataGrid, responsive components, buttons, modals, and consistent styling.

**Benefits**:

- Pre-built components accelerate development
- Maintains consistent design language
- Provides accessibility features out of the box
- Robust table functionality

#### 2.10 Error Handling & Notifications

Snackbar alerts for failed API calls and comprehensive logging for backend routes.

**Benefits**:

- Provides immediate feedback to users
- Helps developers debug issues quickly
- Improves overall user experience
- Tracks errors for monitoring and improvement

#### 2.11 Sorting & Filtering Capabilities

All table columns support sorting and filtering.

**Benefits**:

- Focus on relevant products without UI complexity
- Consistent interaction patterns

## Current Limitations

### 1. Test Coverage

The test cases currently implemented focus primarily on important calculations and critical functionality. While core features are well-tested, there are still areas that need comprehensive coverage:

- Frontend component testing needs expansion
- Edge case scenarios require additional test coverage
- Integration tests between frontend and API layers could be more thorough
- End-to-end testing suite not yet implemented

### 2. Docker Configuration

The Dockerfile is currently at a basic functional level. To make it production-ready, improvements are needed:

- Production-optimized configurations
- Security hardening and vulnerability scanning
- Environment-specific configurations

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Maturity

The CI/CD pipelines are at a foundational level and fulfill current development needs, but require enhancement for enterprise-grade deployment:

- Automated security scanning and vulnerability checks
- Performance testing integration
- Deployment rollback strategies
- More comprehensive automated testing gates

### 4. Frontend Limitations

Some edge cases and advanced scenarios need attention:

- UI components may not fully handle extreme edge cases (very large image arrays, exceptionally long product descriptions)
- Charts may require performance optimization for datasets with 10,000+ items

### 5. Data Persistence

Currently using cached dummy data. A production database implementation is needed for:

- Real-time data updates
- Data persistence across sessions
- Multi-user support

## Future Improvements

Given more time, the following enhancements would significantly improve the application:

### 1. Address Current Limitations

- Expand test coverage to include comprehensive frontend, integration tests
- Upgrade Dockerfile with production-grade optimizations and security measures
- Enhance CI/CD pipelines with advanced deployment strategies and monitoring
- Optimize frontend for all edge cases and extreme data scenarios

### 2. Edit Functionality

- Allow stakeholders to edit product information directly from the dashboard
- Implement inline editing in the data table for quick updates

### 3. Database Integration

- Implement proper database solution (Supabase or PostgreSQL)
- Real-time data synchronization capabilities

### 4. File Download Options

- Export filtered and sorted data to CSV format
- Generate PDF reports with charts and summaries
- Custom report builder for stakeholders and email delivery

### 5. Advanced Analytics

- Historical trend analysis with time-series charts
- Predictive analytics for inventory management
- Comparative analysis between product categories
- Real-time alerts for low stock or pricing anomalies

### 6. User Management & Permissions

- Role-based access control (admin, manager, viewer)
- User authentication and authorization
- Activity logs and audit trails
- Personalized dashboard preferences per user
- Team collaboration features

### 7. Performance Optimization

- Implement virtual scrolling for large tables
- Code splitting and lazy loading for faster initial load
- Image lazy loading and progressive enhancement
- CDN integration for static assets

### 8. Integration Capabilities

- REST API for third-party integrations
- Webhook support for real-time notifications
- Import data from external sources (CSV, API)
- Integration with inventory management systems
- E-commerce platform synchronization
